          <h1>Plan or not to plan a project!</h1>
          <small>June, 2021</small>
          <p>
            Planning in general has a dopamine hit to it, no matter what kind of
            project I am working on planning it has always excited me, sometimes
            to the point of me even delaying the execution. In this article I
            will expand on my insights of building a plan project vs non-planned
            project.

          <h1>Wrapping up 2020- Here’s what I learned</h1>
          <small>December, 2020</small>
          <p>
            There are plenty of guys in this world who we’re no match for, and
            it’s natural to find people like that amazing. I think being able to
            dive headfirst into things is a talent in and of itself, and it
            doesn’t matter what you call them. And it’s not like genius is an
            insult. But if you’re thinking they’re geniuses from the start, that
            just means you’ve lost before you even had a match with them. And
            it’s rude. -Haikyuu

            This is not a technical article, it’s rather me expressing a journey

          <h1>Why You Should Learn Web Development And How To Code</h1>
          <small>May, 2020</small>
          <p>
            Nowadays Technology has escalated so much that it is possible for
            anyone to learn absolutely anything whether it is medicine or design
            but people are still restricted to their respective fields and are
            afraid to explore or dive into different fields looking at the
            current advancement in technology and movements such as no code
            movements it has become very much easier for anyone to create a
            website for themselves or for other people so now the question which
            arises is why should you pay someone else to do the things you can
            easily implement?

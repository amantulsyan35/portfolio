          <h1>Why You Should Learn Web Development And How To Code</h1>
          <small>May, 2020</small>
          <p>
            Nowadays Technology has escalated so much that it is possible for
            anyone to learn absolutely anything whether it is medicine or design
            but people are still restricted to their respective fields and are
            afraid to explore or dive into different fields looking at the
            current advancement in technology and movements such as no code
            movements it has become very much easier for anyone to create a
            website for themselves or for other people so now the question which
            arises is why should you pay someone else to do the things you can
            easily implement?

          <h1>Breaking Apart My React Project</h1>
          <small>June, 2021</small>
          <p>
            I started learning web development in 2019 and have completed
            countless courses on html, CSS, react, JS, node and many more, but
            my inability to learn programming properly without the right set of
            mental models and practices landed me in a loop what people commonly
            know as the tutorial hell.<br />

            <br />React in particular, I have completed around 4 courses all
            from different teachers in order to desperately equip myself with
            react, but none of them helped or it's better to say I didn't know
            how to learn from any of them, this year I started everything from
            scratch even html and CSS this time with the proper mental models
            which are quite useful and underrated and with the proper practice
            oriented approach(more on that later) and this change in approach
            has benefited me a lot in my learning progress.<br />

            <br />In this article/blog/break down I'll be attempting to share
            everything I learned while making a massive react project along the
            course.
